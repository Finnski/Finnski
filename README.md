<b> Finn is my name </b>
I am supposed to be in another meeting arranged by chief gate-keeper J. Calvert again.
<i> She needs to remove any religious or political interests (/i> from her mind during my SSR becaise <b> I own it </b>
Education is intended to be completely secular and impartial in nature. <b> No more academic integrity coup to be seen here </b>
The real reason I want to go to University is to start my career in scientific research with regards to <b> sustainable energy production </b> , food chemistry and medicinal sciences.
Also I would like to start engaging in sport such as freestyle gymnastics, olympic weightlifting, athletics and water sports.
If one starts enjoying life a bit more I will probably be less inclined to take overdoses of medicines and narcotics.
I hate flash mobs too.
Finally for the record, I play the piano, flute and piccolo so I can be useful even during downtime post-surgery.
Helpful Things include: reading glasses, sound-cancelling headphones, regular rest breaks, non-radiolabelled drinking water, access to LAN and secure VPN services.
During my studies I would prefer to be as discrete as humanly possible.
Jacqui Bird MRN Msci et al. diagnosed me with Autistic Spectrum Disorder in August 2021. I was assessed as being autistic in August 2014 by a psychologist with a PhD.
Also during my studies and in my sporting career I require access to glucose (or substrate which can be biochemically converted into glucose or  ketones) because I am prone to hypoglycaemic episodes and ketoacidosic crisis, which may be life threatening if untreated,
